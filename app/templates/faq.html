			<div class="question">My preferred platform is not listed, why?</div>
			<p>
				To avoid unecessarily cluttering the website, we list platforms up to
				the PS3 / Xbox 360 / Wii era, as those were the first generation of
				consoles to make use of online features for a lot of games. Internet
				connectivity might have existed in older games but microtransactions
				were not really a concern yet.

			<div class="question">How to help?</div>
			<p>
				First create an account by clicking on the "Account" menu in the bar at
				the top of the screen, then head to the "Contribute" menu, type the name
				of a game, then click on "Review". Thank you a lot for helping!
